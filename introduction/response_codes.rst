Response Codes
==============

Standard HTTP response codes are used. Anything in the 2XX range indicates a successful response and the 4XX range
indicates there is a problem with your request.

The most common response codes are:

**Success Codes**

- 200: Successful response.
- 201: Resource created successfully.
- 204: Resource updated successfully, no content is included in the response.

**Failure Codes**

- 401: The request requires authentication.
- 403: The user is not permitted to perform the action.
- 404: Resource could not be found.
