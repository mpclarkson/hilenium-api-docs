API Overview
============

The `Hilenium`_ public API follows REST conventions and uses HTTP verbs and response codes to ensure you
can securely access resources without requiring complex libraries.

Cross-origin resource sharing is supported. All responses are in JSON format.

.. note::

    While we do keep track of requests made with each API key, we do not *currently* impose any rate limits or restrictions
    on the number of requests that can be made.
